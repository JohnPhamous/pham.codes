## Background

I was fixing a bug on the [Next.js website](https://nextjs.org/). The bug was that on mobile-sized viewports, there was unexpected horizontal scrolling.

### Quickly Finding the Cause

I use this snippet to find the elements causing the horizontal scrolling. The snippet logs all elements that are wider than the document's width. These elements are usually the ones causing the horizontal scrolling.

```javascript
const documentWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;

document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach((node) => {
  if (node.offsetWidth > documentWidth) {
    console.log(node);
  }
});
```

### Bonus Tip

#### Scroll Element into View

If you're using a Chromium browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.), then you can tell the browser to scroll the page so the element is within view. You can do this by right clicking on the element in the console and click on "Scroll into view".
