Hello reader. If you've found yourself reading this, you're probably a prospective or current student at UCR. I'm writing this for you!

My goal is to make this an all-encompassing review of my experience as a computer science undergraduate.

All names mentioned are pseudonyms unless marked otherwise. This is to focus the review on behaviors and systems rather than individual people.

Any negative feedback is given in earnest. I do not doubt the countless hours of hard work the faculty and staff put in to provide the best education and environment possible for the students.

## Background

I was an undergraduate at UC Riverside from 2015 to 2019. I was a mechanical engineering major for a quarter. I switched to computer science after getting exposed to programming at [Citrus Hack](https://citrushack.com).

During my undergrad, I was involved with student clubs ([ACM](https://acmucr.org)), [taught a CS course](https://github.com/JohnPhamous/introduction-to-python-course), and [built](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) [websites](https://www.ee.ucr.edu/) [and](http://csamba.ucr.edu/) apps for the campus.

Overall, I had an awesome experience at UCR. UCR didn't have the prestige or notoriety to jump start your success but that doesn't mean success isn't possible.

## Courses

Here are some notes on all the CS courses I took along with some breath/depth courses that I found really useful.

Overall, I believe the course plan is great if the goal is to set you up to be an embedded systems engineer. If your goal is to build apps, you will need to supplement what you learn in the classroom with personal projects and internships.

### CS010: Intro to CS 1

- Learn C++ and programming basics like: variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- Textbook and coding environment was on [zyBooks](https://www.zybooks.com/) and [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)

### CS011: Intro to Discrete Structures

- Set theory, don't remember any remarkable

### CS012: Intro to CS 2

- More C++ with object-oriented programming
- Still on zyBooks and Cloud9; I would have liked this to be the course where they taught how to program outside of a classroom environment. Many peers were handicapped for internships because they didn't know how to program outside of Cloud9.
- **Note**: If you're taking or have taken this class, you should be able to program outside of zyBooks/Cloud9. Trust me, the experience is waaaay nicer.

### CS014: Data Structures and Algorithms

- Teaches you the intro material for Leetcode
- **Note**: You'll usually take this class winter or spring quarter of your freshmen year. This is kind of late if you want to interview for internships. Most interviews take place in the fall and winter. If you want to do an internship the following summer, you should review the course materials during the fall.
- **Note**: Pay attention in this class! This class will teach you the tools you need to know to solve problems during interviews.

### CS061: Machine Organization and Assembly

- Teaches you how a very basic computer is made and works
- Failed it the first time (whoops)
- This class is really memorization-heavy. I'd suggest using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to help learn the material.

### CS100: Design Patterns

- Learn some of the [Gang of Four Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by building a terminal shell
- **Note**: Pay attention in this class! Design patterns are used everywhere, being able to recognize their use and knowing when to use them will make you a "rockstar" engineer

### CS111: Discrete Structures

- This class was just straight up hard with not really any reward. Usually hard classes are hard because by the time you pass it, you'll have leveled up in some aspect. This class failed to do that.
- Lots of proofs to memorize, the exams were graded on how close to verbatim your answer is to the proof. Forgetting to use the word "the" could be the difference between a 100% or a 50%.

### CS120A: Logic Design

- You'll learn how to combine basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) to express complex logic (addition, subtraction, multiplication)

### CS120B: Embedded Systems

- Learn how to express systems with finite state machines
- I really liked the lab and capstone project. The capstone project gives you the freedom to build pretty much anything you want. I built a [ukulele that teaches you chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20wSy8CgxoM).

### CS141: Intermediate Data Structures and Algorithms

- Follow up course to CS014 covering more data structures and algorithms
- The exams are pretty much the same to whiteboarding interviews (minus the conversational part). You'll be given a prompt and be asked to write an optimal algorithm to solve it. You'll also need to write down what the space and runtime complexities are.
- **Note**: Pay attention in this class! This class will teach you the tools you need to know to solve problems during interviews.

### CS150: Automata and Formal Languages

- All I remember is lots of circles and arrows

### CS152: Compiler Design

- I found this class really interesting. Up until this point, the programs you write just magically work (sometimes). This class shows you how the C++ you write gets compiled to run on the machine.
- I use a lot of concepts taught in this course regularly for example: using abstract syntax trees to do a massive code change automatically

### CS153: Operating Systems

- Learn how an operating system works by building one
- This class was great! The concepts you learn don't just apply to operating systems but to any system you build.

### CS161: Computer Architecture

- This class is meh. You learn how to be a compiler by taking C++ code and handwriting the x86 assembly instructions.
- I think the concepts should be taught, but the huge effort in getting students how to write assembly, do loop unrolling, and other optimizations by hand is a waste of time.

### CS164: Computer Networks

- Yes! One of the first classes I really wanted to take. Most of my experience up until this point had been in web development so I had high motivation for this class.
- The labs stay pretty basic. You do some multi-machine networking but it's all through VMs on a single machine. This class doesn't teach you how to set up a distributed system's network topology on a cloud provider.

### CS170: Intro to Artificial Intelligence

- This is not the AI you hear about today (neural networks, deep learning, etc.)
- This teaches you the first form of artificial intelligence, representing a question as a tree and traversing the tree to find the solution
- This class will not teach you the "state-of-the-art" in artificial intelligence

### CS171: Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining

- You learn a few machine learning models conceptually and by implementing them by hand
- Be prepared to write a lot of infinite loops

### CS172: Intro to Information Retrieval

- Learn how to get useful information from a large dataset (same lines as Google getting you useful search results from every website)
- The project is really useful and fun; build a full-stack web app to search a large corpus and build your own indexer

### CS179G: Senior Design: Database Systems

- Teaches you different databases as they related to relational (graph, document, wide-column, etc.)
- Your capstone project is to use a database.

### CS181: Programming Languages

- If you have the opportunity to take this class, take it!
- Teaches you different programming paradigms like Prolog and Haskell
- **Note**: I suggest taking this class to learn when to use different languages. UCR teaches primarily C++. You can _technically_ use C++ to solve any problem you run into, but it may not be the best language to use. Being exposed to different languages and paradigms will help inform your decision making when you face problems.

### CS183: System Administration

- Teaches you how to be an IT admin managing servers and networks

### EDUC102: Pedagogy

- Teaches you how to teach
- I find this useful everyday: mentoring others, hosting workshops, writing content

### ENGR101I: Junior-level Seminars

- This is a once a weekly seminar where a guest speaker (usually an engineer) gives a talk then does a question and answer
- I found this useful, but not as a junior. I would have preferred this be given to freshmen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it difficult to register for courses?

### How did I get my internships?

### How many internship positions did I apply to each term?

### What was my Leetcode strategy?

### Did I do research with faculty?

### Do I use differential equations, calculus, or assembly in my work?

### Was I happy at UCR?

Yeah! Many of my best friends were made there. Tons of great experiences.

### Is the 4+1 CS masters program worth it?

I didn't do it. My reasoning is I didn't need a master's to get to the goal is wanted. You should ask people who are doing it to get their perspective.

### Is honors worth it for CS majors?

I didn't do honors. Out all of my peers (n=about 200), only 1 did. I didn't see any value in doing it.

### What do you think were the biggest factors to your success?

Hackathons, student clubs, friends to do the first 2 with
